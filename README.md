### Running locally

Modularscale a static site built with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/). [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) are required for the following instalation. If you are using a Mac, you already have Ruby installed.

1. Clone the repo
2. In the terminal, `cd` into the directory
3. Run `bundle install` in terminal
4. Run `bundle exec middleman` in terminal
5. Visit [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567/)

From now on, you can skip #1 and #3.

To build the app, run `bundle exec middleman build` and it will generate a `build` directory.
